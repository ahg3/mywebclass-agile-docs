As a developer, I want to have an automated build process for the website template, so that I can spend more time on development and less time on manual processes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The build process should be initiated automatically every time a new commit is made to the code repository.
2. The build process should create a new build artifact every time it is run and ensure that the artifact is stored in a designated location.
