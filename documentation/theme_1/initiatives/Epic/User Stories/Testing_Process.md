As a tester, I want to have a consistent and automated testing process, so that I can identify and fix issues earlier in the development cycle.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The testing process should be triggered automatically every time a new build artifact is created.
2. The testing process should include a suite of automated tests that cover all major features and functionalities of the website template.
