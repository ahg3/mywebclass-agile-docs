Epic: "Establishing a Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipeline"

Description: This epic involves setting up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline for the MyWebClass website template development process. It includes selecting and configuring necessary tools, implementing automation, and defining best practices to improve the software development and deployment process.

Goals:
1. Establish a continuous integration and delivery pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the MyWebClass website template
2. Increase efficiency and speed of the development and deployment process
3. Improve the quality of the website template by ensuring frequent and consistent testing and feedback

User Stories:
1. As a developer, I want to have an automated build process for the website template, so that I can spend more time on development and less time on manual processes.
2. As a tester, I want to have a consistent and automated testing process, so that I can identify and fix issues earlier in the development cycle.
3. As a stakeholder, I want to have a reliable and efficient deployment process, so that I can have new features and updates delivered quickly and consistently.

Dependencies:
1. Availability of technical resources and support for DevOps implementation
2. Successful implementation of DevOps tool selection and implementation plan

Risks:
1. Technical challenges could impact the implementation of the continuous integration and delivery pipeline
2. Team member availability could impact project timeline

Mitigation strategies:
1. Thoroughly researching and testing tools before implementation
2. Regular communication and collaboration between team members
3. Identifying and addressing technical challenges as they arise
4. Estimated Effort: 8 weeks

Business Value:
1. Improved speed and efficiency of the development and deployment process
2. Increased quality of the website template through consistent testing and feedback
3. Increased stakeholder satisfaction and confidence in the development process

Priority: High
